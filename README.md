# Movies_wrangling_analysis_R_Julia
 Data wrangling and analysis using movie datasets obtained from the following sources:

1)	La Fabbrica della Realtà – The first data source used was through this website. This file contained six csv files, and for the purposes of the project, the two datasets used were movies metadata.csv and credits.csv.  
The link for the website is:
https://www.lafabbricadellarealta.com/open-data-entertainment/
https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset 
These datasets were used because they were really unclean, and were good datasets to perform data wrangling in order to convert the data into a form which can enable good data analysis. 
 
2)	Grouplens – This website is also a good source for movie datasets. The name of the dataset folder chosen was Movielens Latest Dataset (small). It was found that the names, the ids of the movies can be extracted from this dataset and then the average movie ratings can be calculated for each of the distinct movies.

Three different files were chosen from this source: movies.csv, ratings.csv and links.csv.
  
3)	data.world – The final source that was used was data.world. This source was selected as it contains a IMDB 5000 Movie Dataset which contained the facebook likes for the movie and the director name. It was realized that during analysis. these factors can also be used to see whether the success of the movie is dependent on these or not.

For running the Jupyter Notebooks:
Make sure the datasets are extracted from the attached compressed file and put into the same folder as the Jupyter Notebooks.
